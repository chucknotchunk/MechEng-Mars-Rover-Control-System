The central controller serves as the brain of the MechEng Mars Rover, orchestrating the actions of various subsystems to ensure efficient and reliable operation. This section outlines the decision-making process used by the central controller to execute commands and manage the roverâ€™s activities.

**Key Processes:**
The central controller follows four main processes:
1. Command Reception
2. Initial Checks
3. Execution of Commands
4. Monitoring and Feedback

**Flowchart Overview:**
The detailed flowchart illustrating all decision-making processes is shown below.
